## 😫 The Problem

The traditional campus hiring process is broken, leading to significant inefficiencies for all parties involved:
*   **Time-Consuming:** Interviewing over 500 students can take several days or even weeks for corporate recruiters.
*   **Subjectivity:** The feedback provided by human recruiters can often be inconsistent and subjective.
*   **Lack of Feedback:** Students are often left in the dark, not knowing where they went wrong or how to improve.
*   **No Actionable Insights:** Educational institutions lack the data required to identify curriculum gaps and improve student employability.

**The consequence?** Talented students go unnoticed, companies waste valuable resources, and institutional placement records suffer.

## 💡 The Solution: Placify

**Placify** is a full-stack, AI-based assessment platform designed to automate and optimize the campus placement process from start to finish.

Our system can evaluate **40 students per hour** by simulating realistic interviews. We use advanced AI models to analyze not just what a candidate says, but also how they say it. By analyzing facial expressions, tone of voice, speech patterns, and behavioral indicators, we provide a holistic and unbiased assessment of each candidate, without compromising on quality.
